# The Data Science Toolbox Capstone Project

This is the capstone project for The Data Science Toolbox course offered as part of the Key Capabilities in Data Science certificate program administered by UBC Extended Learning.

The Data Science Toolbox course aims to equip students with core skills used in data science disciplines such as working in the shell, creation of virtual entiroments, package management, version control, working in an IED, markdown language and much more.

This project challenged students to create a website through GitHub pages using the skills they acquired throughout the course. The webpage is based on the exploratory data analysis and final report on the Vancouver street trees dataset produced through the Data Visualization course capstone project. The project explores and analyzes the composition of the Vancouver street tree population at the genus level using the statistical visualization library Altair. It attempts to glean insights pertaining to tree stewardship as it relates to the City of Vancouverâ€™s climate adaptation strategy.
